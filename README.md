## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🔬 Project 1: Lung Cancer Prediction

**Type:** Minor Project  
**Objective:**  
Develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of lung cancer in individuals based on features related to lifestyle, symptoms, and medical history.

#### 🔍 Problem Statement
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection is critical for improving treatment success rates. This project aims to leverage machine learning to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer and potentially improve patient outcomes.

#### 🎯 Goal
Predict whether an individual has lung cancer using a dataset containing various health and lifestyle attributes.

#### 📊 Dataset Information
- **Total Records:** 309
- **Features:** 16 columns
- Each row corresponds to an individual's attributes and lung cancer status.

#### 🧬 Features Used
- GENDER (M/F)
- AGE
- SMOKING (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- YELLOW_FINGERS (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- ANXIETY (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- PEER_PRESSURE (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- CHRONIC_DISEASE (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- FATIGUE (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- ALLERGY (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- WHEEZING (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- ALCOHOL_CONSUMING (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- COUGHING (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- CHEST_PAIN (1 = NO, 2 = YES)
- LUNG_CANCER (Target Variable: YES / NO)

#### 📈 Model Comparison Report
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate and generalizable one for production use.

#### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
A detailed report includes:
- Class imbalance handling
- Feature encoding
- Dealing with noisy or correlated features

### 💻 Project 2: Laptop Price Prediction

**Type:** Major Project  
**Objective:**  
Build a regression model to predict laptop prices based on various product attributes, helping companies analyze pricing dynamics in a competitive market.

#### 🔍 Problem Statement
A consumer electronics company is aiming to understand key factors influencing laptop prices to optimize their product design and pricing strategy. The goal is to derive insights into how different specifications affect pricing.

#### 🎯 Goal
Identify significant features affecting laptop prices and build a regression model that can accurately predict the price based on those features.

#### 📊 Dataset Information
- **Target Variable:** `price` (in USD)
- **Features:** Specifications of laptops such as brand, processor, RAM, display, etc.

#### 🧬 Features Used (Example)
- Brand & Model
- Processor Type
- RAM (in GB)
- Storage Type & Size (HDD/SSD)
- GPU Type
- Screen Size & Resolution
- Operating System
- Weight
- Battery Life
- ...and more.

#### 📈 Model Comparison Report
Several models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were evaluated using cross-validation, RMSE, and R² scores.

#### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
The project discusses:
- Handling categorical data with high cardinality
- Normalizing skewed distributions
- Multicollinearity between numeric features
- Feature selection strategies
